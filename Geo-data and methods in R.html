<p>The objective of this assignment is to work with species distributions and environmental data in R. You will learn how to download species locality data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF (<a href="https://www.gbif.org">https://www.gbif.org</a>), and environmental data from Worldclim <a href="https://www.worldclim.org">https://www.worldclim.org</a>) and plot them on a map. You will then run models to predict the distribution of the species based on climatic variables. Finally, you will use your model to predict the distribution of the species 70 years from now.</p>
<p>We have provided an R script containing code to run through an example rather than a glossy set of practical instructions using R Markdown. This is intentional to emulate a common task when using software in research, which is to download scripts from other researchers (e.g. shared on an open source repository like github) and adapt them for your own purposes. The practical is self-contained and provides all the information you need then to tackle the assignment described below for the assessed coursework.</p>
<p>The R script for the practical is here: <a href="https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/273641/modules#module_452047">https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/273641/modules#module_452047</a></p>
<p>Work through this and make sure you understand all the steps, ask a demonstrator if you have any questions. Then you are ready to tackle the assignment.</p>
